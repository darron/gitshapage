Creates a page located at /version.txt with the git SHA of the release after a Capistrano deploy.

That's all it does.

Just put:

require "gitshapage"

In your config/deploy.rb - after deploy:restart it will create the page.

Don't put it in your config/environment.rb - that does bad things.

Haven't tried it with Bundler yet.
